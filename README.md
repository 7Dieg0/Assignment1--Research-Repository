# Assignment 01 - Research Repository

Recently I started to learn Python by myself. I found Python is very powerful which has been widely used for Web development, Automated operation and maintenanceÔºåWeb CrawlerÔºåData analysis, scientific computing, AI, finance, games and other fields.I have big interest in Python, and tried to learn coding.

## A collection of your own code


The attached codings named *01 Practise coding of the course* I created are based on the Roman's questions through lectures, such as *calculate Human's year to dog's age*.


## Code that you've been inspired by 


After practicing Python continuously, I found that writing code in Python can actually draw some simple images. I am paricularly interested in this. I learned how to draw images in Python on the Internet and YouTube, and learned how to draw a python by 'importing turtle' in Python. Please see the files named *02 Draw a python with Python* and *output-Drawing a python with Python*.


Then I tried to draw a cute panda in Python which I really enjoyed. Please find the attached coding named *03 Draw Panda Using Turtle Graphics* and *03 output-Draw Panda Using Turtle Graphics*.


## Things that you think are interesting or just don't understand (with comments) 

The other thing I'm most interested in is the **web crawler**.


 **Web crawler** (also known as web spider) is a program or script that automatically crawls information on the World Wide Web according to certain rules. Heaps famous companies use web crawler technology such as *Google*. 

 - Python can be used for web crawler development, the Python crawler architecture is mainly composed of five parts, namely scheduler, URL manager, web page downloader, web page parser, and application (valuable data crawled).
   - Scheduler: Equivalent to the CPU of a computer, it is mainly responsible for scheduling the coordination among the URL manager, downloader, and parser.
   - URL Manager: It includes the URL address to be crawled and the URL address that has been crawled to prevent repeated URL crawling and loop crawling of URLs. There are three main ways to implement the URL manager: memory, database, and cache database.
   - Web page downloader: Download a web page by passing in a URL address and convert the web page into a string. The web page downloader has urllib2 (Python official basic module), including the need for login, proxy, and cookies, requests (third-party package).
   - Web page parser: By parsing a web page string, we can extract our useful information according to our requirements, or parse it according to the parsing method of the DOM tree. The web page parser has regular expressions (intuitively, convert web pages into strings to extract valuable information by fuzzy matching, when the document is more complex, this method will be very difficult to extract data), html. parser (that comes with Python), beautifulsoup (a third-party plugin, which can be parsed using html.parser that comes with Python, or lxml, which is more powerful than others), lxml (third-party plugins) , can parse xml and HTML), html.parser and beautifulsoup and lxml are all parsed in the way of DOM tree.
   - Application: an application consisting of useful data extracted from web pages.

***I reckon web crawler is one of the most popular and very promising technology at the moment. I hope I coukd learn something about web crawler in the class.***

## The comments of Roman's Markdown files questions as below:

### Did you remember to take regular breaks away from your screen during this week? How often? Did you stretch your body?

Yes, I took a break every 1 hour roughly, have a coffee and watching the mountains in the distance.

### What is Timeboxing? Have you heard of it before? Will you use it?

Never heard that before, I search it on Google, 'Timeboxing is an important concept in agile project management, it is a method of task and time management' . I think I will use it frequently.

### On a a 0-5 scale, how confident are you with each of the assignments?

Probably 4 haha. I will try my best, but my main problem is my poor English.

### What are of you proud of up to this point in the course?

I can try to learn something by myself after course.

### Do you have a personal learning strategy? If so, what parts of your learning strategy worked? What problems did you face? If you don't have a personal strategy yet, what do you think might work? Invent a describe a strategy for yourself. 

Yes, I think I have. I always tell myself 'to be optimistic when you encounter problems, do more online research, and you will find the answer.'

### If you could send a time traveling text message back to yourself at the start of this course, what would it say?

Diego, **please be confident**.

### What is Python?

Python, one of the most popular programming languages in the world, has created everything from Netflix‚Äôs recommendation algorithm to the software that controls self-driving cars. Python is a general-purpose language, which means it‚Äôs designed to be used in a range of applications, including data science, software and web development, automation, and generally getting stuff done.

### Have you developed a habit of exploring?

Not yet, but I relised that it is one of the most important thing in IT learning.

### Have you meditated before?

Yes, I have, sometimes What is the meaning of life pops into my mind üòÇ

### Is there something over which you have gained a degree of mastery before in your life? Gymnastics, Rubik's Cubes, A Video Game? What did it take?


SoccerÔºå I keep practicing soccer skills and made great progressÔºå I realize this also applies to learning in IT.

### Do you consider yourself a developer yet?

Yes definitely, that's why I'm here üòä

### Do you value creativity? As a value itself? What about as a tool for learning to think logically?

Yes, in my mind creativity is the most thing in every industry, It is the key for learning.

### How many tabs do you have open in your web browser right now? What is the ratio of study related tabs to distraction related tabs?

I have opened 5 taps at the moment, 100% study related, Because assignment is a handful.üòÅ

### Have you had a fight response to technology? What does it feel like? How did you overcome this?

It is a  no„ÄÇ New technology means improvedÔºå I always enjoy learning new stuff.

### What is an IDE?

An integrated development environment (IDE) is software for building applications that combines common developer tools into a single graphical user interface (GUI).
