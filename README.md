# Assignment 01 - Research Repository

Recently I started to learn Python by myself. I found Python is very powerful which has been widely used for Web development, Automated operation and maintenanceÔºåWeb CrawlerÔºåData analysis, scientific computing, AI, finance, games and other fields.I have big interest in Python, and tried to learn coding.

## A collection of your own code


The attached codings named *01 Practise coding of the course* I created are based on the Roman's questions through lectures, such as *calculate Human's year to dog's age*.


## Code that you've been inspired by 


After practicing Python continuously, I found that writing code in Python can actually draw some simple images. I am paricularly interested in this. I learned how to draw images in Python on the Internet and YouTube, and learned how to draw a python by 'importing turtle' in Python. Please see the files named *02 Draw a python with Python* and *output-Drawing a python with Python*.


Then I tried to draw a cute panda in Python which I really enjoyed. Please find the attached coding named *03 Draw Panda Using Turtle Graphics* and *03 output-Draw Panda Using Turtle Graphics*.


## Things that you think are interesting or just don't understand (with comments) 

The other thing I'm most interested in is the **web crawler**.


 **Web crawler** (also known as web spider) is a program or script that automatically crawls information on the World Wide Web according to certain rules. Heaps famous companies use web crawler technology such as *Google*. 

 - Python can be used for web crawler development, the Python crawler architecture is mainly composed of five parts, namely scheduler, URL manager, web page downloader, web page parser, and application (valuable data crawled).
   - Scheduler: Equivalent to the CPU of a computer, it is mainly responsible for scheduling the coordination among the URL manager, downloader, and parser.
   - URL Manager: It includes the URL address to be crawled and the URL address that has been crawled to prevent repeated URL crawling and loop crawling of URLs. There are three main ways to implement the URL manager: memory, database, and cache database.
   - Web page downloader: Download a web page by passing in a URL address and convert the web page into a string. The web page downloader has urllib2 (Python official basic module), including the need for login, proxy, and cookies, requests (third-party package).
   - Web page parser: By parsing a web page string, we can extract our useful information according to our requirements, or parse it according to the parsing method of the DOM tree. The web page parser has regular expressions (intuitively, convert web pages into strings to extract valuable information by fuzzy matching, when the document is more complex, this method will be very difficult to extract data), html. parser (that comes with Python), beautifulsoup (a third-party plugin, which can be parsed using html.parser that comes with Python, or lxml, which is more powerful than others), lxml (third-party plugins) , can parse xml and HTML), html.parser and beautifulsoup and lxml are all parsed in the way of DOM tree.
   - Application: an application consisting of useful data extracted from web pages.

***I reckon web crawler is one of the most popular and very promising technology at the moment. I hope I coukd learn something about web crawler in the class.***

## To answer Roman's Markdown files questions as below:

### Did you remember to take regular breaks away from your screen during this week? How often? Did you stretch your body?

Yes, I took a break every 1 hour roughly, have a coffee and watching the mountains in the distance.

### What is Timeboxing? Have you heard of it before? Will you use it?

Never heard that before, I search it on Google, 'Timeboxing is an important concept in agile project management, it is a method of task and time management' . I think I will use it frequently.

### On a a 0-5 scale, how confident are you with each of the assignments?

Probably 4 haha. I will try my best, but my main problem is my poor English.

### What are of you proud of up to this point in the course?

I can try to learn something by myself after course.

### Do you have a personal learning strategy? If so, what parts of your learning strategy worked? What problems did you face? If you don't have a personal strategy yet, what do you think might work? Invent a describe a strategy for yourself. 

Yes, I think I have. I always tell myself 'to be optimistic when you encounter problems, do more online research, and you will find the answer.'

### If you could send a time traveling text message back to yourself at the start of this course, what would it say?

Diego, **please be confident**.

### What is Python?

Python, one of the most popular programming languages in the world, has created everything from Netflix‚Äôs recommendation algorithm to the software that controls self-driving cars. Python is a general-purpose language, which means it‚Äôs designed to be used in a range of applications, including data science, software and web development, automation, and generally getting stuff done.

### Have you developed a habit of exploring?

Not yet, but I relised that it is one of the most important thing in IT learning.

### Have you meditated before?

Yes, I have, sometimes 'What is the meaning of life' pops into my mind üòÇ

### Is there something over which you have gained a degree of mastery before in your life? Gymnastics, Rubik's Cubes, A Video Game? What did it take?


SoccerÔºå I keep practicing soccer skills and made great progressÔºå I realize this also applies to learning in IT.

### Do you consider yourself a developer yet?

Yes definitely, that's why I'm here üòä

### Do you value creativity? As a value itself? What about as a tool for learning to think logically?

Yes, in my mind creativity is the most thing in every industry, It is the key for learning.

### How many tabs do you have open in your web browser right now? What is the ratio of study related tabs to distraction related tabs?

I have opened 5 taps at the moment, 100% study related, Because assignment is a handful.üòÅ

### Have you had a fight response to technology? What does it feel like? How did you overcome this?

It is a no. New technology means improved, I always enjoy learning new stuff.

### What is an IDE?

An integrated development environment (IDE) is software for building applications that combines common developer tools into a single graphical user interface (GUI).

### What did you learn out of the Marshmallow Challenge?

 - Working on a team is important
 - relised Use what is available
 - Don't just focus on being the top

### Did you have any blocks during this challenge? How did you overcome them?

At the beginning our team just focus on building as high as we can, and we used too many marshmallows. It caused that our tower is not stable enough, collapsed several times. We reduced the use of marshmallows and optimized the structure of the towerand and did a good job finally.

### So far, what was the hardest moment of this course for you?

For me the main problem is my English is not enough although I'm keep improving. Sometimes I got lost totally, I felt frustrated. And then I have spent munch more time to understand after course. 

### What is OOP?

Never heard that before, I search it on Google.

Object Oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that relies on the concept of classes and objects. It is used to structure a software program into simple, reusable pieces of code blueprints (usually called classes), which are used to create individual instances of objects. 

### Are you using the canvas content? Do you find it helpful or tedious?

I often use the canvas content, I can discuss my problems with my mates and try to find solution. I use it to browse my course overview to get some learning materials, it is very helpful.

### Which parts of the work did you find tedious?

At the moment, everything is new for me, I never felt tedious so far. To be honest it's more of a challenge for me.

### What is polymorphism?

### Did you hear a self critical voice in your head throughout the process of learning during this last few weeks? What did it say to you? Do you believe what it said?

Yes it is. It said 'Diego your English is so bad, studying IT courses is not suitable for you', I do not believe that, I keep improving my English, I keep practicing Python, searching on line, everything will be fine.

### What is an MVP? How would you describe it to a group of 6 year olds?

A minimum viable product (MVP), is a product with enough features to attract early-adopter customers and validate a product idea early in the product development cycle. In industries such as software, the MVP can help the product team receive user feedback as quickly as possible to iterate and improve the product.

I might give them some life examplesÔºå such as *how to choose a gift for your friend*.

### What is the hardest problem you have solved so far?

### What is pair programming?

Pair programming is a programming method in which two people work together on a single program. The first person is the ‚ÄúDriver‚Äú, who writes the code, the other person is the ‚ÄúNavigator‚Äù who reviews each line of code as it is typed, checking for errors.  They exchange their roles on a regular basis. 

### What are you looking forward to learning about programming?

I want to know more programing langauge and be able to work on them, such as Java„ÄÅC++„ÄÅJavaScript and so on.

### What is conscious listening?

Conscious listening is the act of being intentionally present during communication between yourself and another while being aware of your own and the other‚Äôs feelings and needs. Conscious listening is related to mindful listening, which is allowing another to express him/herself without interrupting, judging, refuting or discounting.

### What is a variable?

Variables are used to store information to be referenced and manipulated in a computer program. They also provide a way of labeling data with a descriptive name, so our programs can be understood more clearly by the reader and ourselves. It is helpful to think of variables as containers that hold information. Their sole purpose is to label and store data in memory. This data can then be used throughout your program.

### What programming languages are you interested in learning? Why?

At the moment my favorite one is Python, Because I'm more familiar with it. But I'm keen to explore more soon.

### What is something kind that someone has done for you?

### If you were describing programming to someone who knows nothing about it, what would you say?

I probably start by explaining that a computer is ‚ÄúA machine for following rules‚Äù‚Ä¶and those rules are computer programs. Then I talk about a cooking recipe as an example, this is a LOT like a computer program - you start at instruction and work down the list doing each step in turn.

### Which parts of this course made you feel doubtful of your own innate ability?

Logic skills sometimesüòí

### What is a fixed mindset?

### What is something kind you have done for someone else?

### Have you done mindfulness or attention training before?

### Have you developed a habit of persevering?
